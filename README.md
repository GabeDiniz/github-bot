# üêô GitHub Discord Bot

This project is a Discord bot integrated with GitHub webhooks to provide real-time notifications about issue events (created/closed) in specific repositories. The bot listens to webhook events via a Flask server and sends notifications to a designated Discord channel.

## Steps to Run

#### Step 1: Start the Webhook Server

Run the Flask server locally:
`python webhook_server.py`

#### Step 2: Expose the Server with ngrok

Start ngrok to expose the local server to the internet:
`ngrok http 5000`

Copy the https:// forwarding URL (e.g., https://<ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app).

#### Step 3: Update GitHub Webhook

1. Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook.
2. Set the Payload URL to the ngrok forwarding URL with /webhook appended (e.g., https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/webhook).
3. Set the Content type to application/json.
4. Enter the Secret that was set in the repos webhook in the .env file.
5. Select the Issues events and save.

#### Step 4: Run the Discord Bot

Start the bot:
`py main.py`
