#### Step 3: Update GitHub Webhook

1. Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook.
2. Set the Payload URL to the ngrok forwarding URL with /webhook appended (e.g., https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app/webhook).
3. Set the Content type to application/json.
4. Enter the Secret that was set in the repos webhook in the .env file.
5. Select the Issues events and save.
